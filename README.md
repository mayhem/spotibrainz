spotibrainz
===========

Spotibrainz is a Spotify application that uses data from MusicBrainz to display data 
from Songkick, synchronized lyrics from MusixMatch (if available), YouTube videos, Tweets, 
Wikipedia summaries and band metrics from Musicmetric.

Each time the track in Spotify changes, this information is updated and automatically 
displayed. The point of this hack is to highlight the vast amounts of useful data that 
MusicBrainz has and to expose it to end-users inside a music application like Spotify.

This hack was created by:

Ian McEwen (MusicBrianz), Heather Strain (Strain Design) and Robert Kaye (MusicBrainz).
